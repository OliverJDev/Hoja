#### Hoja
Hoja is a utility/helper plugin that contains a variety of different components that expedite and aid spigot/bungee developers. Some features include: custom config system, 
entities, serilization/deserilization and data storage, easy to make GUI's and more.

(Wiki Coming Soon)
#### Components
- [`Commands`](https://github.com/OliverJDev/Hoja/tree/master/src/main/java/me/tabbin/commands) - no command registration, children commands, wide range of parameters.
- [`Configs`](https://github.com/OliverJDev/Hoja/tree/master/src/main/java/me/tabbin/config) - easy to use configs, created directly from the variables.
- [`Entities`](https://github.com/OliverJDev/Hoja/tree/master/src/main/java/me/tabbin/entity) - entities are general objects that require data storage, i.e. players, mines, minigames etc...

This helper was inspired by the now deprecated, [MassiveCore](https://github.com/MassiveCraft/MassiveCore)
